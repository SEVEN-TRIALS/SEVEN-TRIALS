*taps my mic* Hello? Hellooo? Am I doing this right? I better be, or else I'll look like an idiot.

So basically, call me whatever you want (literally any name works, I had someone call me Joe Biden for a while). But if you really want a name, call me Ross or whatever character I'm dressed as! Again, I think names are dumb and annoying, so it's really up to you if you want to address me by anything specific.

I also don't have a DNI since I think they're silly and inneffective! But I guess if you're someone who's rude and harrasses others over disagreements and what not, don't talk to me. I don't like arguing and drama, so if you're the kind of person who gets involved in that stuff a lot, then I don't think I want to be friends with you. I like to believe that everyone has the potential to be a good person and when we choose to fight, then it'll only make things worse. I think everyone should be treated with respect and basic kindness, no matter what.

I don't really have many hobbies, but I want to create my own comic one day, so theres that. I also want to make a musical, but I also *really hate watching musicals* so... yeah! That'll... totally go well!

People say that I'm funny, but I don't really think I am? I don't know? What else does one put on a github bio for pony town users to read and assume things about you...

Oh right, interests! I know how much pony town users love to assume how morally intact you are by judging your interests!! ^_^

Anyway! Some interests I kinda have are FAITH: The Unholy Trinity, 9/11, Oceangate, Postal 1997 (plus all the other postal games), FNAF, Flipline/The Papa's Restaurant games, Dragon Ball, Sonic (trying to get back into it), and many more I'm too lazy to name!!

I'm running out of things to say about me, but i also have [this strawpage](https://nostalgiahog.straw.page) that does a better job at showifn who I am! hopefully you'll send me a little gift!
